context in programming refers to the information, conditions, or environment that surrounds and influences a specific task or operation, so here we can say we are creating a global environment where all parts of our application has access to.

in React, the Context API can be used to create a global context that allows you to share data and state across your entire application. This global context is often used for managing application-wide state, user authentication, themes, and other data that needs to be accessible from various parts of your application without prop drilling.

the use of the children prop inside a component is a common pattern for passing content or components as children to other components. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to create reusable components that can render dynamic content or wrap other components.
