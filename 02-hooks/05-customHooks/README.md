## Custom hooks

We can create our own hooks and set up some functionality down there.

A custom hook is simply a way to extract a piece of functionality that you can use again and again. Put differently, you can code a custom hook when you want to avoid duplication or when you do not want to build a piece of functionality from scratch across multiple React projects. By coding a custom hook, you can create a reliable and streamlined way to reuse a piece of functionality in your React apps.
